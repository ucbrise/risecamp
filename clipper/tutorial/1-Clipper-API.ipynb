    "<p>Clipper uses Docker containers as its deployment mechanism. A running Clipper cluster consists of a collection of Docker containers communicating with each other over the network. As you issue commands against Clipper, you are communicating with these containers as well as creating new ones or destroying existing ones. As you explore the Clipper API throughout this exercise, we will illustrate how each command effects the cluster state.</p>\n",
    "<p>The main API for interacting with Clipper is exposed via a <a href=\"http://docs.clipper.ai/en/develop/#clipper-connection\" target=\"_blank\"><code>ClipperConnection</code></a> object.

    "<p>In order to create a <code>ClipperConnection</code> object, you must provide it with a <a href=\"http://docs.clipper.ai/en/develop/#container-managers\" target=\"_blank\"><code>ContainerManager</code></a> object. While Docker is becoming an increasingly standard mechanism for deploying applications, there are many different tools for managing a Docker cluster. These tools broadly fall into the category of <em>Container Orchestration frameworks</em>. Some popular examples are <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Kubernetes</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Swarm</a>, and <a href=\"https://dcos.io/\" target=\"_blank\">DC/OS</a>. One of the reasons we run Clipper in Docker containers is to make the system as general as possible and support many different deployment scenarios. Within the Clipper Admin, we abstract away all of the Docker container-specific commands behind the <code>ContainerManager</code> interface. The <code>ClipperConnection</code> object makes Clipper-specific decisions about how to issue commands, and then makes any changes to the Docker configuration (for example, to launch a container for a newly deployed model) through the <code>ContainerManager</code>. To support different container orchestration frameworks that manage Docker containers in different ways, we create different implementations of the <code>ContainerManager</code> interface.</p>\n",
    "<p>Clipper currently provides two <code>ContainerManager</code> implementations: the <code>DockerContainerManager</code> and the <code>KubernetesContainerManager</code>. In this exercise, you will be using the <code>DockerContainerManager</code>, which runs Clipper directly on your local Docker instance. This <code>ContainerManager</code> is particularly useful for trying out Clipper without needing to set up an enterprise-grade container orchestration framework. The <code>DockerContainerManager</code> is not recommended for production use cases.</p>\n",
