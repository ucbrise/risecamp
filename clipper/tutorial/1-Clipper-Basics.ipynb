    "[Part 2](#Example-Application---Image-Classification) allows you to deploy both a PyTorch CNN to label images of your choosing, as well as a Darknet YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to draw bounding boxes and labels in images.

You can find the complete API documentation for the Clipper Admin tool on our website: <http://docs.clipper.ai>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Be familiar with how to create and manage a Clipper cluster, and understand what happens when you issue Clipper admin commands.\n",

    "#### Context\n",
    "The Clipper Admin tool is distributed through Pip. You can install it with `pip install clipper_admin`, but it has already been installed in this notebook for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clipper uses Docker containers as its deployment mechanism. A running Clipper cluster consists of a collection of Docker containers communicating with each other over the network. As you issue commands against Clipper, you are communicating with these containers as well as creating new ones or destroying existing ones. As you explore the Clipper API throughout this exercise, we will illustrate how each command effects the cluster state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main API for interacting with Clipper is exposed via a [`ClipperConnection`](http://docs.clipper.ai/en/develop/#clipper-connection) object. This is your handle to a Clipper cluster (this collection of Docker containers). It can be used to start, stop, inspect, and modify the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a `ClipperConnection` object, you must provide it with a [`ContainerManager`](http://docs.clipper.ai/en/develop/#container-managers) object. While Docker is becoming an increasingly standard mechanism for deploying applications, there are many different tools for managing a Docker cluster. These tools broadly fall into the category of *Container Orchestration frameworks*. Some popular examples are [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), and [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/). One of the reasons we run Clipper in Docker containers is to make the system as general as possible and support many different deployment scenarios. Within the Clipper Admin, we abstract away all of the Docker container-specific commands behind the `ContainerManager` interface. The `ClipperConnection` object makes Clipper-specific decisions about how to issue commands, and then makes any changes to the Docker configuration (for example, to launch a container for a newly deployed model) through the `ContainerManager`. To support different container orchestration frameworks that manage Docker containers in different ways, we create different implementations of the `ContainerManager` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clipper currently provides two `ContainerManager` implementations: the `DockerContainerManager` and the `KubernetesContainerManager`. In this exercise, you will be using the `DockerContainerManager`, which runs Clipper directly on your local Docker instance. This `ContainerManager` is particularly useful for trying out Clipper without needing to set up an enterprise-grade container orchestration framework. The `DockerContainerManager` is not recommended for production use cases."

    "1. The Query Frontend: The Query Frontend container listens for incoming prediction requests and schedules and routes them to the deployed models.\n",

    "3. A Redis instance: Redis is used to persistently store Clipper's internal configuration state. By default, Redis is started on port 6380 instead of the standard Redis default port 6379 to avoid collisions with any Redis instances that are already running.\n",

    "One of the goals of Clipper is to make it simple to deploy and maintain machine-learning models in production. The prediction interface that models must implement is very simple, consisting of a single function. And the use of Docker makes it easy to include all of a model's dependencies in a self-contained environment. However, deploying a new type of model still entails writing and debugging a new model container and creating a Docker image.\n",
    "To make the model deployment process even simpler, Clipper provides a library of model deployers for common types of models. If your model can be deployed with one of these deployers, you no longer need to write a model container, create a Docker image, or even figure out how to save a model. Instead, you provide your trained model directly to the model deployer function within your Python process. The model deployer takes care of saving the model and building a Docker image that is compatible with your model type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clipper provides model deployers for many common ML packages including PySpark, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc. In addition, Clipper provides a Python model deployer that can deploy arbitrary Python functions as long as they can be pickled. Finally, if none of these fit your needs, you can always write a custom model container that can execute arbitrary code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the base images small, Clipper model containers install only the required dependencies to ensure that a basic model will run. However, if your model requires custom Python packages installed, you can specify these additional packages to the model deployer and it will automatically use Pip to install them inside your model's Docker container. You will use this to install Scikit-Learn when you deploy the flower model.\n",

    "To improve performance during inference, many machine learning models exploit opportunities for data parallelism in the inference process. Because of this, Clipper tries to provide multiple inputs at once to a deployed model. Therefore, models deployed to Clipper must have a function interface that takes a list of inputs as an argument and returns a list of predictions as strings. Returning predictions as strings provides a lot of flexibility over what your models can return. Commonly, models in Clipper will return either a single number (such as a label or score) or JSON containing a richer representation of the model output (for example, by including confidence estimates of predicted labels).\n",

These metrics will be aggregated along with several system metrics and reported to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), a time-series database commonly used for metrics reporting (for example, Kubernetes uses Prometheus for its own system metrics). You can view a simple metrics dashboard automatically exported by Prometheus at port 9090 (`http:://[IP_ADDRESS]:9090`). In practice, a monitoring and alerting system such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is typically layered on top of Promtheus. You will work through an example of connecting Grafana to visualize Clipper's metrics later in the tutorial."

Clipper will occasionally inject additional queries into the system (when it is underloaded) to explore the throughput-latency tradeoff for each model. This exploration algorithm estimates a function that predicts query latency based on the batch size, thereby enabling Clipper to choose the largest batch size (and therefore the highest throughput) that is still capable of returning within the deadline imposed by the latency SLO.
