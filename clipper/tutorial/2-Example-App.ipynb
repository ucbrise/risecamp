Clipper will occasionally inject additional queries into the system (when it is underloaded) to explore the throughput-latency tradeoff for each model. This exploration algorithm estimates a function that predicts query latency based on the batch size, thereby enabling Clipper to choose the largest batch size (and therefore the highest throughput) that is still capable of returning within the deadline imposed by the latency SLO.
