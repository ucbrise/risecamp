    "In this exercise, you will see how many of the projects you've learned about in the last couple days fit together. Those of you who attended last year's RISE Camp will remember the Pong integration exercise that trained an RL policy in Ray and deployed it in Clipper. Today, we're going to extend that verison by tracking some experiments in Flor and encrypting our models with Wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train models to play Pong. The first two will use [imitation learning](https://blog.statsbot.co/introduction-to-imitation-learning-32334c3b1e7a) to learn how to play, and the third will train a reinforcement learning policy using RLlib and Ray. Flor will track the training processes for all three models. We will also encrypt each one of these models with WAVE and deploy & serve the models in Clipper.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you unfamiliar with imitation learning, we will simply take the state of the game (location of the ball, location of the paddle, etc.) combined with the labeled action of a human player and train a classifier that responds ot the state of the game board with the action to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll play a game (or more!) against each of the three models. We'll aggregate the results to see which agent performs the best."
