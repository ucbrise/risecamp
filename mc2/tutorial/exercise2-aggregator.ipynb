    "In this exercise, we'll demonstrate a workflow in which each party has its own data and sends a copy of its data to the central server. Therefore, all the training data is sent over the network to the central server, who collects it and locally trains a model on all the data. The central server will then broadcast the trained model back to the parties, who will load the model and test it on their local test datasets. \n",
