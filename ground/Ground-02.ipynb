    "One use case we have been exploring as a part of the Ground agenda recently is managing the lifecycles of machine learning models using Ground. In particular, we are interested in tracking the code and the data combined to output a particular model. As we've already learned, Ground treats versioning as a first-class citizen. As a result, it is easy to imagine a scenario in which Ground would help users track which particular version of data was used to train a model for reproducibility purposes. \n",
