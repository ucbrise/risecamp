    "To illustrate this, we explore one of the motivating applications for Ground: managing lifecycles for machine learning models. In particular, we are interested in tracking both the code and the data that combine to output a particular ML model. As we've already learned, Ground treats versioning (change over time) independently. As a result, we'll explore a standard scenario in which Ground helps ML developers track the versions of data and code used to train the model. \n"

    "Note that bugs in ML applications can show up in subtle ways beyond just breakage. We'll consider a simple example application that takes an ongoing feed from Twitter, and uses the content of each tweet to predict the location that tweet was posted from. During our scenario, Twitter changes the format of its feed. This does not cause our code to *break*; rather, it degrades the quality of our predictions. The evidence of the problem (poor predictions) can be hard to trace back to a root cause (data format change). Ground's versioning and lineage tracking provide the tools to debug the situation."

Even without machine learning, we can do better. As you might have guessed, the plurality of tweets in the world come from the United States.
