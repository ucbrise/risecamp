    "To get started with Ground, we will use some of the \"Aboveground\" services that we have already developed. Aboveground services are tools that users use to interface with Ground at a higher semantic level than the simple node-and-edge-based API. We will first add the commit history of a git repository into Ground. Then, we'll tell Ground about some of the data that's contained in that repository. Finally, we will run the code contained in the repository. At the end of this section, we will see that Ground kept track of the code and the data; it will also track the execution of the code and understand the lineage between the original data and the cleaned data.\n",
